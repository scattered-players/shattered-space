              </h4>
              <p>
                Artist Tatiana Nya Ford is interested in creative processes that require immense and intricate intimacy,
                vulnerability, and truth and artworks that may not have finality and are not associated with traditional
                standards of beauty or worth. “If we accept the idea that self-expression doesn’t have to be pleasant and
                doesn’t have to mimic a commercial form, or process, then what are the limits of that?” Ford asks.
                Interested in the intersectionality of identity and darker themes of disguising trauma, Tatiana Nya Ford
                tries to convey the link between womanhood and having a voyeuristic relationship with pain, the universal
                impulse to split oneself into a million pieces for the ease of someone else’s consumption, and her own
                inclination to make any experience of her self a carefully crafted performance piece.

                Mani Yangilmau is an indigenous alien nomad, and has made a temporary nesting in the DMV area. Their human

                'methodology.' They dabble but do not pretend to be proficient at writing, devising, directing, and
                producing multiple disciplines of Earth Arts. They are also deeply affected by the Shatter, and send their
                condolences.
